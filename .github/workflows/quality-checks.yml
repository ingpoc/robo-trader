# DEPRECATED: This workflow has been replaced by ci.yml
#
# This file is kept for reference only. The new comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
# is defined in .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# Migration notes:
# - All quality checks now in ci.yml (lint-python, lint-frontend)
# - All tests now in ci.yml (test-backend, test-frontend)
# - Added integration tests, Docker builds, security scanning
# - See .github/WORKFLOWS.md for complete documentation
#
# To remove this file after migration is complete, delete it from the repository.
