When below 30, it might be oversold and could rise. RSI divergence (when price and RSI move in opposite directions) often signals trend reversals.",

The indicator works best in ranging markets and loses effectiveness in strong trends. Look for RSI divergences, failure swings, and centerline crossovers for trading signals."

When it crosses below, it's bearish. The histogram shows the difference between MACD and signal line.",

Prices touching the upper band suggest overbought conditions, while touching the lower band suggests oversold conditions. Band squeeze often precedes significant price moves.",
            "advanced": "Bollinger Bands measure volatility using standard deviation. The %B indicator shows where price is within the bands (above 1 = above upper band, below 0 = below lower band). Band width indicates volatility - narrow bands often precede breakouts."

            "advanced": "Advanced stop loss techniques include trailing stops (move up as price rises), time-based stops (exit after certain period), and volatility-adjusted stops (wider stops for volatile stocks).

A common rule is to risk no more than 1-2% of your portfolio on any single trade. Kelly Criterion provides mathematically optimal position sizes based on win rate and average win/loss ratio.",
            "advanced": "Optimal position sizing balances risk and reward using probabilistic models. The Kelly formula calculates: f = (bp - q) / b, where b=odds, p=win probability, q=loss probability. Risk-adjusted sizing considers correlation between positions and portfolio volatility."
