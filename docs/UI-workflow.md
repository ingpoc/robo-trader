# Full-Stack Development Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the standardized workflow for handling full-stack development in the Robo Trader project, which uses a segregated architecture with React frontend and FastAPI backend. The workflow follows the **"plan-develop-integrate-test-deploy"** cycle to ensure seamless frontend-backend coordination and prevent integration issues.

## ðŸ”„ Plan-Develop-Integrate-Test-Deploy Cycle

### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture
**When a user suggests a feature or bug fix:**

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
**Deploy changes to production environment:**

#### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checks
- [ ] Run full test suite (frontend + backend)
- [ ] Verify environment configurations
- [ ] Check CORS settings for production domains
- [ ] Validate API endpoint URLs and WebSocket connections
- [ ] Performance testing in staging environment

#### Step 2: Deployment Execution
- [ ] Deploy backend first (API-first deployment)
- [ ] Deploy frontend after backend is verified
- [ ] Update environment variables and configurations
- [ ] Run database migrations if needed
- [ ] Verify health checks pass

#### Step 3: Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections work in production
- [ ] Test critical user workflows
- [ ] Monitor for any integration issues

### Phase 6: Feedback & Iteration
**If issues are discovered post-deployment:**

#### Step 1: Issue Triage
- [ ] Analyze error logs and user reports
- [ ] Identify whether issue is frontend, backend, or integration-related
- [ ] Determine severity and impact
- [ ] Coordinate with team for rapid response

#### Step 2: Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Review code changes against established patterns
- [ ] Check for integration points that may have failed
- [ ] Verify API contracts and data flow
- [ ] Identify gaps in testing or monitoring

#### Step 3: Hotfix Implementation
- [ ] Implement fixes following established workflow
- [ ] Prioritize critical issues for immediate deployment
- [ ] Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
- [ ] Add additional monitoring for similar issues

#### Step 4: Retrospective & Improvement
- [ ] Document lessons learned from the issue
- [ ] Update workflows or rules if gaps were found
- [ ] Improve testing coverage for problematic areas
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### Phase 3: Reflection & Rule Updates
**Once the user agrees that the fixes are satisfactory:**

#### Step 1: Process Reflection
- [ ] Document what went wrong in the initial implementation
- [ ] Identify gaps in current UI rules that allowed the mistake
- [ ] Analyze whether rules were unclear, incomplete, or misinterpreted
- [ ] Consider if new patterns or guidelines are needed

#### Step 2: Mistake Analysis
- [ ] Categorize the type of mistake:
  - Rule misinterpretation
  - Missing rule coverage
  - Implementation error
  - Requirements misunderstanding
- [ ] Document specific scenarios that weren't covered

#### Step 3: Rule Enhancement
- [ ] Update `.kilocode/rules/ui-rules.md` with:
  - New rules to prevent similar issues
  - Clarified existing rules
  - Additional examples or patterns
  - Enhanced checklists or guidelines
